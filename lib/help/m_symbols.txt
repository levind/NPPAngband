     Any of these symbols may be changed using preference files, accessed using
the command '=' followed by 'v'.  You may review what a symbol means by typing '/' or '~'.

     Moria can also use graphics instead of text to display your surroundings;
unfortunately, no convenient listing of them yet exists.
